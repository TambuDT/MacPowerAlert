# MacPowerAlert

MacPowerAlert is a macOS application that monitors your Mac's battery status and notifies you when the battery is at 20% or 80%.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/MacPowerAlert.git`
3. Open the project in Xcode: `open MacPowerAlert.xcodeproj`
4. Configure build settings and select "My Mac" as the target device.
5. Build the project.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. The app will start monitoring the battery status every minute.
3. You'll receive notifications when the battery is at 20% or 80%.

## Why avoid discharging below 20% and charging above 80%

Keeping your Mac's battery between 20% and 80% charge can help extend the battery's lifespan. Recharging the battery when it's around 20% and stopping the charge when it reaches 80% can reduce stress on the battery and slow down the aging process.
